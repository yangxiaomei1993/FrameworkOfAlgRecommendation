The 1, 3, 4 can be found from the paper "Improved Dataset Characterisation for Meta-learning"

There are four different kinds of meta-features employed in our experimental
1. The traditional data set characteristics
   1) Number of features
   2) Number of nominal features
   3) Number of numerical attributes
   4) Number of instances
   5) Number of target concept values
   6) Default accuracy **
   7) Total number of missing values
   8) Number of instances with missing values
   9) Mean skewness of the numerical features
   10) Mean kurtosis of the numerical features
   11) Number of features for which the ratio between the alpha-trimmed standard
-deviation and the standard-deviation is larget than 0.7
   12) Boxian M-Statistic to test for equality of coveriance matices of the numerical
attributes.
   13) Degrees of freedom of the M-Statistic
   14) Value of the Chi-square distribution
   15) A transformation of the M-Statistic which assesses the information in the
co-variance structure of the classes
   16) Relative proportion of the total discrimination powee of the first discriminant function
   17) Canonical correlation of the best linear combination of attributes to distinguish between classes
   18) Discrimination power between the classes
   19) Bartlett's V-Statistic to the significance of discriminant functions
   20) Entropy of classes
   21) Entropy of symbolic features
   22) Mutual Information between symbolic attributes and classes
   23) Average joint entropu of the symbolic features and the classes
   24) ratio between class entropy and average mutual information, providing
information abount the number of necessaey attributes for classification
   25) Ratio between noise and signalm, indicating the amount of irrelevant
information for classification

2. The complexity based data set characteristics
    1) Length of class boundary
    2) Percentage of retained adherence subsets
    3) Ratio of average intra/inter class nearest neighbor distances
    4) Nonlinearity of linear classifier
    5) Nonlinearity of NN
    6) Maximum Fisher's discriminant ratio
    7) Number of instances/number of features

3. The model based data set characteristics
    C5.0
    1) Width of the tree
    2) Height of the tree
    3) Number of the nodes
    4) Number of the leaves
    5) maxLevel
    6) meanLevel
    7) devLevel
    8) LongBranch
    9) ShortBranch
    10) MeanBranch
    11) DevBranch
    12) MaxAttr
    13) MinAttr
    14) MeanAttr
    15) DevAttr
    
4. Landmarking based data set characteristics
    1) Naive Bayes
    2) Linear discriminant
    3) Best node of decision tree
    4) Worst node of decision tree
    5) Average node of decision tree
